# Predicting Employee Churn to Drive Retention üè¢üîç

## Project Overview
This project focused on developing a predictive model to identify employees at risk of leaving the company (churn) and implementing targeted strategies to retain them. By leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning, the objective was to reduce turnover, improve employee satisfaction, and enhance overall organizational performance.

## Data Acquisition and Preparation
1. Data Source: Employee data was sourced from [e.g., HR systems, performance management databases].
2. Cleaning & Preprocessing: The data underwent extensive cleaning to manage missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Relevant features, including job role, tenure, performance ratings, salary, and demographics, were meticulously selected for the analysis.
3. Tooling: Google Colab was used in conjunction with BigQuery for data extraction and manipulation, providing a scalable and efficient platform for handling large datasets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Objective: To gain insights into employee behavior, identify patterns, and discover potential correlations between various factors and employee churn.
2. Key Metrics: Analyzed metrics such as turnover rate, average tenure, and employee satisfaction levels.
3. Visualization Techniques: Employed a variety of visualization techniques, including histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices, to explore the relationships between different variables and identify potential predictors of churn.

## Machine Learning Model Development
1. Algorithms Evaluated: Multiple machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression, were assessed to predict employee churn.
2. Model Selection: The Random Forest model was selected as the optimal model based on its superior performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. Training & Validation: The model was trained using historical employee data and validated through cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and generalizability.

## Dashboard Development
1. Tool Used: A dynamic and interactive dashboard was developed using Google Looker Studio (formerly known as Google Data Studio). This dashboard provided an intuitive interface for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) related to employee churn, satisfaction, and retention.
2. Features: The dashboard featured interactive elements, allowing users to explore data at different granularity levels (e.g., department, job role, tenure) and to monitor trends over time.
3. Impact: The dashboard became an essential tool for HR and management teams, enabling them to make informed, data-driven decisions regarding employee retention strategies.

## Key Findings and Recommendations
1. Significant Predictors: The analysis identified key predictors of employee churn, such as job role, tenure, and performance ratings.
2. High-Risk Segments: Employee segments with particularly high turnover rates were pinpointed, providing insights into areas needing immediate attention.
3. Actionable Insights: The project led to actionable recommendations, including the implementation of targeted retention programs, personalized employee development initiatives, and specific workplace 
improvements designed to enhance job satisfaction.

## Results and Impact
1. Reduction in Turnover: The strategies derived from the analysis resulted in a [percentage]% reduction in the employee turnover rate, directly contributing to improved organizational stability.
2. Dashboard Utilization: The Looker Studio dashboard has been integrated into regular HR practices, offering ongoing insights that help guide management in making strategic, employee-focused decisions.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of data analytics and machine learning in predicting employee churn and driving targeted retention efforts. By combining predictive modeling with powerful data visualization tools, the organization was able to take proactive steps to enhance employee satisfaction, reduce turnover costs, and ultimately boost overall performance.
